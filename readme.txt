It includes most of the datasets applied in the paper "Association of Aerobic Glycolysis with the Structural Connectome Reveals a Benefit-Risk Balancing Mechanism in the Human Brain".

1 The human functional network is contained in the file named "human_fc.mat".

2 The human structural network is contained in the file named "human_sc.mat".

3 The macaque structural network, which was published in the previous work [1], is contained in the file named "macaque_matrix.mat".

4 The mouse structural network, which was published in the previous work [2], is contained in the file named "mouse_matrix.mat".

5 Aerobic glycolysis from positron emission tomography (PET) data was published in the previous work [3]. Anyone who need this data please contact with the authors in the original literature [3].
